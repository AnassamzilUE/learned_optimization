# Part 2: Custom Tasks, Task Families, and Performance Improvements

In this part, we will look at how to define custom tasks and datasets. We will also consider _families_ of tasks, which are common specifications of meta-learning problems. Finally, we will look at how to efficiently parallelize over tasks during training.

## Prerequisites

This document assumes knowledge of JAX which is covered in depth at the [JAX Docs](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).
In particular, we would recomend making your way through [JAX tutorial 101](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jax-101/index.html). We also recommend that you have worked your way through Part 1.

"""## Defining a custom Dataset

The dataset's in this library consists of iterators which yield batches of the corresponding data. For the provided tasks, these dataset have 4 splits of data rather than the traditional 3. We have "train" which is data used by the task to train a model, "inner_valid" which contains validation data for use when inner training (training an instance of a task). This could be use for, say, picking hparams. "outer_valid" which is used to meta-train with -- this is unseen in inner training and thus serves as a basis to train learned optimizers against. "test" which can be used to test the learned optimizer with.

To make a dataset, simply write 4 iterators with these splits.

For performance reasons, creating these iterators cannot be slow.
The existing dataset's make extensive use of caching to share iterators across tasks which use the same data iterators.
To account for this reuse, it is expected that these iterators are always randomly sampling data and have a large shuffle buffer so as to not run into any sampling issues.

"""## Meta-training on multiple tasks: `TaskFamily`

What we have shown previously was meta-training on a single task instance.
While sometimes this is sufficient for a given situation, in many situations we seek to meta-train a meta-learning algorithm such as a learned optimizer on a mixture of different tasks.

One path to do this is to simply run more than one meta-gradient computation, each with different tasks, average the gradients, and perform one meta-update.
This works great when the tasks are quite different -- e.g. meta-gradients when training a convnet vs a MLP.
A big negative to this is that these meta-gradient calculations are happening sequentially, and thus making poor use of hardware accelerators like GPU or TPU.

As a solution to this problem, we have an abstraction of a `TaskFamily` to enable better use of hardware. A `TaskFamily` represents a distribution over a set of tasks and specifies particular samples from this distribution as a pytree of jax types.

The function to sample these configurations is called `sample`, and the function to get a task from the sampled config is `task_fn`. `TaskFamily` also optionally contain datasets which are shared for all the `Task` it creates.

As a simple example, let's consider a family of quadratics parameterized by meansquared error to some point which itself is sampled.

"""## Limitations of `TaskFamily`
Task families are designed for, and only work for variation that results in a static computation graph. This is required for `jax.vmap` to work.

This means things like naively changing hidden sizes, or number of layers, activation functions is off the table.

In some cases, one can leverage other jax control flow such as `jax.lax.cond` to select between implementations. For example, one could make a `TaskFamily` that used one of 2 activation functions. While this works, the resulting vectorized computation could be slow and thus profiling is required to determine if this is a good idea or not.

In this code base, we use `TaskFamily` to mainly parameterize over different kinds of initializations.
